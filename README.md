# üéµ  1.1-Inheritance and Polymorphism

> A complete set of exercises focused on Object-Oriented Programming in Java.  
This project includes implementations from basic inheritance and interfaces to more advanced modeling with abstract classes and complex relationships.

---

## üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement

This repository contains the full solution for **Sprint 1** of the Object-Oriented Programming track.  
The sprint is divided into three levels with increasing complexity:

### ü•Å Level 1  
- Models a music band with different types of instruments: wind, string, and percussion.
- Uses abstract classes and method overriding.
- Demonstrates static and instance initialization blocks in Java.
- Includes an additional exercise about `static`, `final`, and instance members using a `Car` class.

### üì± Level 2  
- Defines a `Phone` class and extends it with a `Smartphone` class that implements two interfaces: `Camera` and `Clock`.
- Demonstrates interface implementation and method calls from a main method.

### üì∞ Level 3  
- Models a sports news agency with editors and categorized news items (Football, Basketball, Tennis, F1, Motorcycling).
- Demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and static/shared class variables.
- Includes methods to calculate the score and price of a news article based on specific domain logic.
- A menu-based system is included to interact with the user and manage editors and news articles.

## üíª Technologies Used

- Java (SDK 23)
- IntelliJ IDEA (used for development)
- No external dependencies or frameworks

## üìã Requirements

Before running this project, make sure you have:

- Java SDK **17+** (SDK 23 was used during development)
- IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (recommended for easier navigation)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get a local copy of the project:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/maarselo/1.1-InheritancePolymorphism.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd java-oop-sprint1
```
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

To run the program:

1. Open the class that contains the `main()` method.
2. Click the green **Run** button in IntelliJ IDEA, or press **Shift + F10**.
3. If IntelliJ prompts you to sync or import dependencies, confirm the action.

Each exercise (level) can be executed individually.  
For example, Level 3 includes a console-based menu where you can interact with the news system.

## üåê Deployment

This project is intended to run in a **local development environment** only.  
No production deployment configuration has been defined.

Future improvements could include turning the project into a web or desktop application.
