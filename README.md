# 🎵 Java OOP Exercises - Sprint 1

> A complete set of exercises focused on Object-Oriented Programming in Java.  
This project includes implementations from basic inheritance and interfaces to more advanced modeling with abstract classes and complex relationships.

## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This repository contains the full solution for **Sprint 1** of the Object-Oriented Programming track.  
The sprint is divided into three levels with increasing complexity:

### 🥁 Level 1  
- Models a music band with different types of instruments: wind, string, and percussion.
- Uses abstract classes and method overriding.
- Demonstrates static and instance initialization blocks in Java.
- Includes an additional exercise about `static`, `final`, and instance members using a `Car` class.

### 📱 Level 2  
- Defines a `Phone` class and extends it with a `Smartphone` class that implements two interfaces: `Camera` and `Clock`.
- Demonstrates interface implementation and method calls from a main method.

### 📰 Level 3  
- Models a sports news agency with editors and categorized news items (Football, Basketball, Tennis, F1, Motorcycling).
- Demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and static/shared class variables.
- Includes methods to calculate the score and price of a news article based on specific domain logic.
- A menu-based system is included to interact with the user and manage editors and news articles.
